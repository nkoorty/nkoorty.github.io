I've been quite successful at hackathons, so here's a list of all the hackathons I've won and their repos, if available.

### Ripple: New Horizon Hackathon - 1st Place
Built an iOS App that uses the XRP EVM sidechain for subscriptions and loyalty schemes powered by the Ripple blockchain in an effort to make subscriptions easier and more decentralised.

### Sorobanathon - 2nd Place 
This was my first online hackathon that I worked solo on. I built an iOS App that splits bills between friends using Soroban smart contracts. It was my first time writing smart contracts in Rust, so quite exciting. Came second, won $5,000.

This one's interesting, I actually took part in 2 project, and got first place in both. One was a music NFT marketplace on iOS, and another was a NFT marketplace that uses AR. Won $2,000, so $1,000 for each project.

### Harvard Polkadot Hackathon - 1st Place
Built an iOS App that

This was super exciting, since I got to fly all the way to Harvard to take part in this hackathon. I got to meet some really cool people, and it was a great experience overall. Built kind of a game with collectibles - not my best hackathon project admittedly. Won $5,000.

### ImmutableX Hackathon - 1st Place
This was a gaming hackathon, so the approach you've seen in the previous hackathons won't work. Nonetheless, we built a hypercasual game in Swift using SceneKit and to our (genuine) surprise, we won. Won $5,000.

### IC Hack 23 - 1st & 2nd Place 
This is really exciting because it's the UK's largest student-run hackathon. My team and I built a epileptic seizure detector using the Terra API and, you guessed it, it's an iOS app. We engineered and algorithm that uses motion data from the gyroscopes of wearables and applied FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms) onto that data to sample the frequencies, and found the frequency bands that are most likely to be associated with epileptic seizures.

Overall, we won 1st place for the "DocSoc Hidden Technology" challenge, and 2nd place for the "Terra API" challenge. No fancy prizes, but amazing experience and excited to have come home with 2 trophies.
