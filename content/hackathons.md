I've been quite successful at hackathons, so here's a list of all the hackathons I've won and their repos, if available.

### Ripple: APEX Hackathon - 1st Place
Built KeyGuard - the first decentralized key management (DKM) infrastructure built on the XRP Ledger. It enables dApps to efficiently and securely manage account signer keys in a decentralized manner. Won $5,000.

### Stacks Harvard Hackathon - 2nd Place
We placed 2nd place using Coast, a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) iOS app that transforms BTC into a practical payment option for everyday purchases. Users can buy products by making a small upfront payment and collateralising the rest with BTC, then pay off the balance in regular instalments using fiat or BTC.

### Ripple London Hackathon - 2nd Place
Built RipSplit - an iOS dApp built on the XRP EVM sidechain. It simplifies the process of splitting expenses and settling payments by using account abstraction and uses smart contracts to facilitate group management in a trustless and decentralised manner. Won $3,000.

### Vechain x BCG Hackathon in Cambridge, UK - 3rd Place
We built DishDeal, a reduce-food-waste to earn iOS app that uses augmented reality and machine learning to tokenise food into 3D NFTs, connecting consumers with restaurants that have excess food. Upon purchase and feedback, users are rewarded with B3TR tokens for each transaction, redeemable for future discounts or events at the participating restaurants. Won $2,000.

### ETH Global LFGHO Hackathon - 1st Place x2
GhoShare is an iOS app created to address the spesific shortcoming in current expense splitting apps by enabling decentralised direct in-app settlements of payments using credit delegation, token swapping and cross-network transactions.

### Sorobanathon - 2nd Place 
This was my first online hackathon that I worked solo on. I built an iOS App that splits bills between friends using Soroban smart contracts. It was my first time writing smart contracts in Rust, so quite exciting. Came second, won $5,000.

### NAVH Consensys Hackathon - 1st Place x2

### Harvard Polkadot Hackathon - 1st Place
Built an iOS App that

This was super exciting, since I got to fly all the way to Harvard to take part in this hackathon. I got to meet some really cool people, and it was a great experience overall. Built kind of a game with collectibles - not my best hackathon project admittedly. Won $5,000.

### ImmutableX Hackathon - 1st Place
This was a gaming hackathon, so the approach you've seen in the previous hackathons won't work. Nonetheless, we built a hypercasual game in Swift using SceneKit and to our (genuine) surprise, we won. Won $5,000.

### IC Hack 23 - 1st & 2nd Place 
This is really exciting because it's the UK's largest student-run hackathon. My team and I built a epileptic seizure detector using the Terra API and, you guessed it, it's an iOS app. We engineered and algorithm that uses motion data from the gyroscopes of wearables and applied FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms) onto that data to sample the frequencies, and found the frequency bands that are most likely to be associated with epileptic seizures.

Overall, we won 1st place for the "DocSoc Hidden Technology" challenge, and 2nd place for the "Terra API" challenge. No fancy prizes, but amazing experience and excited to have come home with 2 trophies.
